'''
This file contains the first naive algorithm.

The algorithm consists of two phases. In the first phase, the outcome of a match is estimated. This happens in three
steps. The first step considers the achievements of both teams in the current season up to now. This is done by
comparing their rank in the table. (...) In the second
phase, the result of the match is guessed.
